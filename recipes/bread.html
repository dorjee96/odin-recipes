    <p><em>Moist</em> Sour Cream White Bread</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>2 1/4 teaspoons(1 package) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon canola oil, plus more for greasing the pan</li>
        <li>3 cups bread flour, plus more as needed</li>
        <li>1 large egg white, <b>well-beaten</b>, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>In a large bowl, mix warm water and yeast. With a wooden spoon, stir in the sugar, salt, sour cream, and canola oil. Add 2 cups of flour and stir until well combined.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add enough of the remaining 1 cup flour to make a dough that holds together and follow the spoon around the bowl.</p></li>
        <li><p>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 10 minutes, adding more flour as needed until the dough is firm and smooth to the touch.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place dough in a medium greased bowl. Turn dough over in a bowl so that the top is also lightly greased. Cover with clean cloth and let rise in warm, draft-free place for 1 hour.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Punch</b> down dough in the bowl.</p></li>
        <li><p>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead for 5 minutes or until the bubbles are out of the bread.</p></li>
        <li><p>Shape dough into a loaf.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place the loaf in greased 9 X 5-inch bread pan. Cover and let rise in a warm, draft-free place for 45 minutes or until doubled in size. Meanwhile, position a rack in the center of the oven and heat to 375 F. Brush the loaf with egg white if a glossy crust is desired.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake for 45 minutes or until bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when the top is tapped. Remove bread from the pan and let cool on a wire rack before slicing.</p></li>
